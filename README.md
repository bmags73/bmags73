👋 Hi, I’m @bmags73 - true!
👀 I’m interested in learning the world of everything Linux systems administration/automation
🌱 I’m currently learning how to administrate SELinux, Vim, and std.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything Linux at the moment.  I do want to collaborate to allow
    my skills reinforcement learning, by interacting and teaching others what I have already learned.
📫 How to reach me is through github at the moment.  I am more pressed for time trying to read work/personal emails

I hope that helps anyone that peruses through my site here on GH.
